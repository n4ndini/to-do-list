# to-do-list
hey what's up
this is going to be my first project
it's going to be a to do list
and i'm trying to make it like notion
wish my luck!!


~~~~~~some important info~~~~~~
branches should be named as follows:

    admin features: /v1/admin/feature-name/
    security features: /v1/security/feature-name
    (add other stuff as necessary)

filing system:
    the following folders should be in this project:
        - tests
        - functions
    each feature that is made needs to have it's own individual test 
    and implementation file. this is to avoid the unnecessary hassle of 
    merge conflicts (ifykyk).


that's all for now!! more info will be added as i progress, see you guys soon!
