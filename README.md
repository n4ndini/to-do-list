# to-do-list
hey what's up
this is going to be my first project
it's going to be a to do list
wish me luck!!


~~~~~~some important info~~~~~~
branches should be named as follows:
    task features: v1/tasks/feature-name
    calendar features: v1/calendar/feature-name
    bin features: v1/bin/feature-name

filing system:
    the following folders should be in this project:
        - tests
        - functions
    each feature that is made needs to have it's own individual test 
    and implementation file. this is to avoid the unnecessary hassle of 
    merge conflicts (ifykyk).

functions and technicality:
(add the route names next to list item once implemented)
    
    --- functionality ---
        - create list
        - delete list (delete whole list)
        - edit list
        - create task
        - delete task (checking off task)
        - edit task
        - task overview (dashboard)

        - due today (shows tasks due today on dashboard)
        - recover list
