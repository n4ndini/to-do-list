# to-do-list
hey what's up
this is going to be my first project
it's going to be a to do list
and i'm trying to make it like notion
wish my luck!!


~~~~~~some important info~~~~~~
branches should be named as follows:
    admin features: /v1/admin/feature-name/
    security features: /v1/security/feature-name
    (add other stuff as necessary)

filing system:
    the following folders should be in this project:
        - tests
        - functions
    each feature that is made needs to have it's own individual test 
    and implementation file. this is to avoid the unnecessary hassle of 
    merge conflicts (ifykyk).

functions and technicality:
(add the route names next to list item once implemented)
    --- user ---
        - create user
        - login
        - password update
        - email update
        - username update
    
    --- functionality ---
        - create list
        - delete list (delete whole or all tasks completed)
        - create task
        - delete task (checking off task)
        - task overview
        - list overview
        - trash view
        - retrieve trash
